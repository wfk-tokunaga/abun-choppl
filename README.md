# Next Time I
A user friendly application that allows musical composers to list their compositions, view other users by composition, and find compositions by instruments used.

## User Story 

As a USER interested in sharing your musical composition, 
I WANT  to have an easy way to upload my new piece of music, along with a link to the score, a recording, and a list of the instruments used in that composition, SO THAT others can view it.

GIVEN a homepage with a global list of compositions,
When I click on a composition, I'll be brought to the page for that composition, where I can SEE MORE INFORMATION about that composition, such as the instruments used, length, title, and optional score and recording links. 
 
When I CLICK ON ANOTHER USER'S USERNAME, I am redirected to their profile, where I can see their bio, name, contact information, and their compositions. 

When I CLICK ON AN INSTRUMENT NAME, I am taken to that instrument's page, where I can see all compositions that feature that instrument. 

## What I Did 
I built an application with a web responsive polished UI that allows users to upload compositions and display extra information for each composition, which other users can then view.

## How I Did It 
Creating a back-end consisting of an Express server, MySQL database, and the Sequelize object relational mapping (ORM) module. To authenticate users, I used the express-sessions NodeJS module. 
Additionally, I used vanilla HTML and CSS to create a mobile-first responsive front-end design. 

## Demo
** Below is a short demo of our application.

## Future Development
The Next Time I team has several plans for future development. The main plans include being able to embed multiple recording links, having the option to tip the artists, and continued improvement of the UI.
